Welcome
[0000:Welcome.

This program will test whether your graphics card supports the resolutions
required by Extreme Assault (Copyright 1997 Blue Byte Software).

Important!
Before starting this program be sure to close all files and programs -
under certain circumstances it could bomb your computer.

You will be shown the title screen of EXTREME ASSAULT.
A border will appear on screen, it defines the entire screen area that you
should be able to see. Note that in the dithered modes colors may appear a bit
strange.

If successful, the screen will be displayed for about 5 seconds. After that
you will be asked whether the screen was displayed correctly.

In the unlikely case that the new resolution causes your computer to crash,
just reboot and then restart this program.
It will automatically detect the cause and then continue with the test.

Do you want to continue? (Y/N)]
