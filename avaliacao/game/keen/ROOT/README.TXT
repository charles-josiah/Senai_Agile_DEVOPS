1. What's in the Demo

In this demo version of EXTREME
ASSAULT, you'll fly the Sioux AH-23
through the first part of Operation
Zones One and Two.  You'll
experience breathtaking real-time 3D
graphics that flow smoothly without
the need for any expensive graphics
accelerator cards.  Check out the
awesome visual effects like fog,
transparent laser barriers, and
scorch marks left on the terrain
from your gun blasts.

The action is fierce, so be sure you
don't miss the bonuses that re-
energize your shield and replenish
your ammunition. In this demo, your
helicopter has very powerful weapons
systems, but there will be more
available in the final version.

Also missing in this demo, is the
T1. It's a powerful high-tech
battle tank you'll command in later
Operation Zones. There are many
more features that are found only in
the final version including: unique
multi-player levels, rockin' CD
audio tracks and additional types of
cunning opponents.

12. Playing Extreme Assault

After the initial title screen, a
screen with four pilots will appear.
These pilots represent the various
difficulty levels, from the easiest
in the top left corner to the most
difficult in the bottom right
corner. In this demo, there is only
one pilot available. After you have
chosen this pilot, the main menu
will appear. It contains the
following points:

1. New Game
 Here is where you start a new
game. Before you begin, however,
it pays to be sure that the
helicopter's controls will
function the way you want them
to. See section 16, Controls
Setup, to adjust the controls.

2. Continue Game
 This will automatically load your
last successfully completed
mission.

3. Load Game
 Choose this to load any of your
saved games. Your progress will
automatically be saved after
every successful mission.  You
will be shown all successfully
completed missions for each pilot
and can choose where you would
like to begin.

4. Change Pilot
 In the final version, you will be
able to change pilots (difficulty
levels) here.

5. Options
 By clicking on "Options" in the
main menu an "Options Menu" will
appear. You can also call up the
"Options Menu" during the game,
by pressing the F2 key. It
contains the following choices:
 The Sound Setup
 Resolution Setup
 Graphic Detail Level
 Controls Setup
 These sections are fully
explained in sections 13 through
16 respectively.

6. Network Play
 This is another option that is
only available in the final
version of EXTREME ASSAULT.

7. Credits
 Find out who is responsible for
EXTREME ASSAULT.

8. Quit Game
 Ends Extreme Assault.



13. The Sound Setup

1. Briefing
 Select the way in which you
receive your briefings: text
only, voice only, or text and
voice together.  Only the "text
and voice" option is available in
this demo version.

2. Music Selection
 Normally, you could pick what
type of music you'll hear: Midi,
CD Audio or no music.
Unfortunately, the CD Audio
selection is not available in
this demo version.

3. Midi Volume
 The volume level is presented in
slide-bar form: left is soft and
right is loud.

4. Sound Effects Volume
 This slide-bar adjusts the volume
of all sound effects as well as
the volume of the voice
transmissions. Again, left is
soft and right is loud.

5. Number of Effects
Here you can adjust the number of
simultaneously audible sound
effects. The more effects
available the better the sound
quality; however, it also means
that your computer will run more
slowly. If you encounter
problems with processing speed,
try reducing the number of
effects available.


14. Resolution Setup

Adjust the resolution quality
available for your missions. Tryout
the different resolutions and pick
the one which best suits your taste.

Note:  If you choose a resolution
that is not supported by your
graphics card and the game still
starts, (games 	sounds are heard),
but no picture appears, then press
"F5" after the briefing. This will
switch the resolution from LowRes
to HiRes or vice versa. If you can
now see a picture, press "F2", and
use the OPTION MENU to 	change to a
different resolution.

Note:  "F5" allows you to switch
between LowRes and HiRes, even
during the game.

Caution!  Because this is a demo
version, it's possible that the
resolution you chose, although
supported by your system, still
does not function properly. In case
this should occur, please try
another resolution.


15. Graphic Detail Level

Select the level of graphic detail
that best meets your playing
requirements.  Of course, an
increase in graphic detail will
decrease the speed of your computer.
Play the game with the various
options and decide on a balance that
you like best.


16. Controls Setup

1. Configure the controls to operate
the way you want.  Click on the
object to be defined (i.e. Keyboard),
and press the desired letter or key 
for each command or control element. 
The same applies for a joystick, but
instead of a letter or key, it's
the movement that needs to be
defined.

2. Choose from one of the three
available control types: arcade,
normal and pilot.

3. A special control function we
added to EXTREME ASSAULT is called
drift.  Imagine that you are
trying to avoid the fire of an
attacking opponent, but don't
want to lose sight of him.  Drift
allows you to move laterally to
the left or right without turning
your helicopter.

You can assign drift left and
right with the same joystick
movements as turn left and right.
Define drift with the "ALT" key,
(naturally it can be any
available key you desire), and
define drift left and drift right
with the appropriate joystick
movements.  Now during the game,
to drift left or right, just
press the "ALT" key and make the
joystick movement for left or
right. As soon as you release
the "ALT" key, you'll return to
the natural turning movement.


17. The Cockpit

1. Shield Display
 The energy bar at the top middle
of the screen shows the amount of
shield energy you have remaining
to deflect enemy fire. When the
energy level reaches zero, the
next shot is fatal.

2. Weapons Display
 In the top left and right corners
of the screen there are three
lines of symbols. They indicate
the amount of ammunition
remaining for each on-board
weapons system. In the left
corner, from the top down, these
systems are: the Razor Gun, Laser
Cannon and Fire Flash. From the
top, in the right corner, there
are Guided Missiles, Smart Bombs
and Thunderbolts.

3. Razor Gun
 It's a powerful, fully automatic
machine-gun that fires armor-
piercing rounds; these rounds are
guided by the Target Sight (see
Target Selection below).

4. Laser Cannon
 This cannon fires laser blasts in
the direction the helicopter is
facing. There is no guidance
system available for this weapon.

5. Fire Flash
 A highly developed hi-tech weapon
that fires lightning bolts. The
penetrating force of this weapon
is extremely high. It is
available only later in the game
and does not come with a guidance
system.

6. Guided Missile
 You'll start the game with six
Guided Missiles. When your
magazine has less than six
missiles left, you can pick up
refills wherever you find them.
The Guided Missile doesn't have a
spectacular name, but it is a
very effective weapon against
fast and heavily armored
opponents. There isn't a lot
that an opponent can do to get
away from it. To take advantage
of the Guided Missile feature, be
sure to first select a target
(see Target Selection below).  If
this is not done then the
missiles will not track their
target.


7. Smart Bomb
 These bombs are not available
right away, but you'll probably
run across them during the game.
The Smart Bomb is the most
advanced and, like its name
indicates, the most intelligent
bomb in existence. The bomb
disperses numerous rockets
simultaneously which seek out any
target in range.  If you happen
across a large group of deadly
enemy forces, it may prove
advantageous to have one or more
of these bombs available.

8. Thunderbolts
 You have to find these bombs as
well, but they sure are worth it.
The Thunderbolt functions like a
conventional guided missile; it's
upon impact that you notice the
difference.  It covers an entire
area with grenades and is very
effective against tightly grouped
stationary units. It's also
fascinating to watch the effect
it has on aerial vehicles that
are threatening your chopper.

9. Target Selection
 Target selection is accomplished
by pushing the assigned key.
This key can be defined in the
Control Setup menu. The Sioux
AH-23's target selection system
can lock-on any target within the
Target Sight.  When multiple
targets are within this circular
sight, the one nearest to the
cross hairs will be picked when
the select key is pressed.

 When a target has been locked-on,
a Lead Point will appear that
shows the opponents calculated
position based on his current
speed and direction. This point
not only indicates where the
opponent will be at the time of
impact but also whether or not he
is in range.



18. Confronting The Enemy!

After you've chosen a pilot, made
the necessary setup decisions and
started EXTREME ASSAULT, you'll begin
with a mission briefing.  Your
headquarters transmits mission
orders and important warnings over
the radio.  Don't be surprised if
you experience transmission
disturbances once and a while.  They
are not due to problems with your
computer!  These problems are caused
by atmospheric disturbances.

You'll soon notice that two
helicopters are approaching your
location.  Don't be alarmed; their
choppers are no match for your Sioux
AH-23!  After you blow them out of
the sky, take some time to
familiarize yourself with the
controls, before starting the next
mission.  One of those enemy
choppers left behind an "extra" when
he crashed.  Fly near the site so
you can pick up whatever it is.  You
can always collect  extras so long
as there is enough room on board.

This time the extra is ammo for your
Razor Gun.  Now you'll be able to
fire with all barrels, and be more
effective against enemy targets.
Naturally, that is only possible so
long as the additional ammo holds
out.  Press "F12" when you're
comfortable with the helicopter and
its controls.  The second mission
briefing will then start, but this
time we'll let you carry out the
mission yourself.  Good Luck!

Have fun with the test version!
